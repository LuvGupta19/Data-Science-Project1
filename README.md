# Project 1 - Lending Club
Data analysis was performed on real life dataset and then was modeled and Web App was made in Flask and deployed in Heroku.


### Dataset - LendingClub dataset 
(https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club)

LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It which do provide loans to its customers mainly on the basis of credit score. 


So customers with high Credit Score are simply provided the loan with low interest rate as they are more likely to pay back. But the ones with low credit score its a risk to give them the loan. They maybe simply not provided the loan or it could be like they are provided the loan on high interest. 


So we developed a model and predicted  whether or not a borrower will pay back their loan. Goal is to prevent investing on '"bad loans". 


The machine learning/deep learning model that could predict which of the high interest loans are more likely to be returned, would bring added value by minimizing the associated risks. Also, using other factors along with credit score may help us to identify the high risky loans and minimize the investors loss of money more accurately.



### Task

First, implemented some data engineering and preprocessing on LendingClub dataset and prepared data for analysis and modeling. 
Then applied explanatory data analysis (EDA) to investigate the features. 
At the end, used preprocessed data on LendingClub loans labeled on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charged-off) to develop a model and predict whether or not a borrower will pay back their loan.
